# SQL RAG Agent – AtliQ T-Shirts Retail Analytics

An LLM-powered **SQL + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent** that answers natural language questions over a retail database for a fictitious apparel company, **AtliQ T-Shirts**.

The agent translates user questions into optimized SQL queries, executes them safely, and returns **business-friendly answers** grounded in actual database results.

## 🏪 Business Context

AtliQ T-Shirts is a fictional retail brand selling T-shirts across multiple brands, sizes, colors, and price points.  
Discounts are applied at the brand level and may or may not be present for every product.

Business users often need quick answers such as:
- “Which T-shirt has the lowest discount?”
- “What is the total revenue for Levi brand?”
- “Which products are currently in stock?”
- “How do discounts affect total revenue?”

- brand  
- color  
- size
